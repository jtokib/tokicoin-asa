---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures Implemented

### Environment Variable Protection
```bash
# SAFE: Using environment variables
export CREATOR_MNEMONIC="your mnemonic here"
node scripts/createAsa.js

# UNSAFE: Never do this
const CREATOR_MNEMONIC = "actual mnemonic in code"; // ‚ùå NEVER!
```

### Enhanced .gitignore
```gitignore
# Sensitive files - NEVER COMMIT THESE
*.mnemonic
*mnemonic*
*private*
*secret*
*wallet*
*.key
*.pem
*-test.js
test-*.js
TESTING_*.md
```

### Secure Script Templates
- All scripts now require environment variables
- No hardcoded sensitive data anywhere
- Clear error messages when environment variables missing
- Example files use placeholder data only

---

## üöÄ Pre-Mainnet Deployment Checklist

### Before Creating Mainnet ASA:
- [ ] Verify `CREATOR_MNEMONIC` environment variable is set
- [ ] Confirm mainnet account is funded with sufficient ALGO
- [ ] Double-check network is set to 'mainnet' in scripts
- [ ] Run `git status` to ensure no sensitive files staged
- [ ] Test scripts on testnet first if making changes

### Before Distribution:
- [ ] Recipients have provided valid Algorand addresses
- [ ] Recipients understand they need to opt-in to ASA
- [ ] Distribution list uses environment variables or external files
- [ ] No hardcoded addresses or mnemonics in scripts

### Before Website Deployment:
- [ ] Update `website/.env.local` with mainnet Asset ID
- [ ] Verify `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Test website locally before deployment
- [ ] Confirm environment variables load correctly

---

## üîê Ongoing Security Practices

1. **Always run `git status` before commits**
2. **Use temporary environment variables: `export VAR="value"`**
3. **Delete test files with real data immediately after use**
4. **Never store mnemonics in any file that could be committed**
5. **Regularly audit scripts for hardcoded sensitive data**

# üîß TARGETED REMEDIATION PROMPTS

## CRITICAL FIX #1: Remove Hardcoded Mnemonic

**Run this command when ready:**
```
Remove the hardcoded mnemonic from scripts/tools/check-mnemonic.js and replace with environment variable pattern like other scripts. Also check if this account has any funds that need to be moved to safety.
```

**Expected Changes:**
- Remove line 7 with hardcoded mnemonic
- Replace with `process.env.RECIPIENT_MNEMONIC` pattern
- Add validation for missing environment variable
- Add instructions for setting the env var

---

## HIGH FIX #2: Fix Hardcoded Test Address  

**Run this command when ready:**
```
Replace the hardcoded recipient address in scripts/test/test-transfer.js with an environment variable or generated test address pattern.
```

**Expected Changes:**
- Replace hardcoded address on line 13
- Use `process.env.TEST_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS` or generate random test address
- Add error handling for missing test configuration

---

## HIGH FIX #3: Fix Hardcoded Asset ID

**Run this command when ready:**  
```
Remove hardcoded Asset ID from scripts/core/distrbute.js and ensure it always loads from environment variables.
```

**Expected Changes:**
- Remove hardcoded assetId: 743521125 from CONFIG object
- Ensure Asset ID comes from `process.env.ASSET_ID`
- Add validation for missing Asset ID environment variable

---

## HIGH FIX #4: Reduce Address Logging

**Run this command when ready:**
```
Remove or mask the creator address logging in scripts/core/tokicoin.js to protect privacy while keeping essential functionality.
```

**Expected Changes:**
- Remove or mask the console.log on line 46
- Keep functionality but protect sensitive address information
- Consider logging only last 6 characters: `console.log('Creator Address:', addr.slice(-6))`

---

## HIGH FIX #5: Add Input Validation

**Run this command when ready:**
```
Add comprehensive input validation to all functions in scripts/core/tokicoin.js including address validation, amount bounds checking, and mnemonic format validation.
```

**Expected Changes:**
- Add address validation using algosdk.isValidAddress() consistently
- Add amount bounds checking (positive numbers, reasonable limits)
- Add mnemonic validation (25 words, valid format)
- Add proper error messages for invalid inputs

---

## HIGH FIX #6: Fix Default Network Configuration

**Run this command when ready:**
```
Change the default network in scripts/core/distrbute.js from 'mainnet' to 'testnet' to prevent accidental mainnet operations.
```

**Expected Changes:**
- Change line 7: `constructor(network = 'testnet')` instead of 'mainnet'
- Add explicit warnings when mainnet is used
- Require confirmation for mainnet operations

---

## HIGH FIX #7: Sanitize Error Messages

**Run this command when ready:**
```
Review and sanitize error messages across all scripts to prevent information disclosure while maintaining debugging capability.
```

**Expected Changes:**
- Replace detailed system errors with generic user-friendly messages
- Log detailed errors to secure logs/console but show sanitized errors to users
- Remove stack traces and internal paths from user-facing errors
