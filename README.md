> **Warning**: This is a memecoin with absolutely no utility or value. Created purely for fun and educational purposes.

## Overview

TokiCoin is a memecoin created purely for fun and to share with friends. It has no utility, no roadmap, and no grand mission - just like a good memecoin should be. Built on Algorand for fast, cheap transactions.

## Token Economics

- **Total Supply**: 20,000,000 TOKI
- **Initial Market Cap**: $20
- **Initial Price**: $0.000001 per TOKI
- **Decimals**: 6
- **Symbol**: TOKI
- **Network**: Algorand (Mainnet)

## Technical Requirements

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.0.0 or higher
- npm or yarn
- Algorand wallet with ALGO for transaction fees
- Basic understanding of blockchain transactions

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tokicoin-asa.git
cd tokicoin-asa
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables for local testing:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your testnet configuration
# NEVER commit .env.local to version control!
```

4. Set up website (optional):
```bash
cd website
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit website/.env.local with your asset configuration
```

## Usage

### Creating the ASA on Testnet

1. Run the script to generate a new account:
```bash
node tokicoin.js
```

2. Fund the generated account with testnet ALGOs:
   - Visit [Algorand Testnet Dispenser](https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/dispenser)
   - Enter your account address
   - Request testnet ALGOs

3. Uncomment the `createASA` call in `tokicoin.js` and run again:
```bash
node tokicoin.js
```

### Creating the ASA on Mainnet

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This will create a real asset on Algorand mainnet and cost real ALGOs.

1. Change network to 'mainnet' in the script
2. Use a funded mainnet account
3. Run the creation script

### Distribution Script

```javascript
const { TokiCoinASA } = require('./tokicoin.js');

async function distribute() {
    const tokiCoin = new TokiCoinASA('mainnet');
    const assetId = 'YOUR_ASSET_ID'; // Replace with actual asset ID
    
    // List of friends to send TOKI to
    const recipients = [
        { address: 'FRIEND1_ADDRESS', amount: 1000000 }, // 1 TOKI
        { address: 'FRIEND2_ADDRESS', amount: 1000000 }, // 1 TOKI
        // Add more friends...
    ];
    
    for (const recipient of recipients) {
        try {
            await tokiCoin.transferASA(
                assetId,
                'YOUR_CREATOR_MNEMONIC',
                recipient.address,
                recipient.amount
            );
            console.log(`Sent ${recipient.amount} TOKI to ${recipient.address}`);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`Failed to send to ${recipient.address}:`, error);
        }
    }
}

distribute();
```

## API Reference

### TokiCoinASA Class

#### Constructor
```javascript
const tokiCoin = new TokiCoinASA(network);
```
- `network`: 'testnet' or 'mainnet'

#### Methods

##### `createASA(creatorMnemonic)`
Creates the TokiCoin ASA on the specified network.

**Parameters:**
- `creatorMnemonic`: 25-word mnemonic phrase of the creator account

**Returns:** Promise resolving to `{ assetId, txId, creatorAddress }`

##### `optInToASA(assetId, accountMnemonic)`
Opts an account into the ASA (required before receiving tokens).

**Parameters:**
- `assetId`: The ASA ID
- `accountMnemonic`: 25-word mnemonic phrase of the account

**Returns:** Promise resolving to transaction ID

##### `transferASA(assetId, fromMnemonic, toAddress, amount)`
Transfers tokens between accounts.

**Parameters:**
- `assetId`: The ASA ID
- `fromMnemonic`: Sender's mnemonic
- `toAddress`: Recipient's address
- `amount`: Amount to transfer (in micro-units)

**Returns:** Promise resolving to transaction ID

##### `getASAInfo(assetId)`
Gets information about the ASA.

**Parameters:**
- `assetId`: The ASA ID

**Returns:** Promise resolving to ASA information

##### `generateNewAccount()`
Generates a new Algorand account.

**Returns:** `{ address, mnemonic, secretKey }`

## Security Considerations

### üîí Critical Security Features
- **Comprehensive `.gitignore`**: Blocks all sensitive files (`*.mnemonic`, `*private*`, `*secret*`, etc.)
- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data in `.env.local` (never committed)
- **Input Validation**: Address validation and balance checks before transactions
- **Mnemonic Protection**: Console logging of sensitive data is masked/disabled
- **Network Separation**: Mainnet files are blocked from accidental commits

### üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices
1. **Never store mnemonics in code** - Use environment variables only
2. **Test on testnet first** - Always validate functionality before mainnet
3. **Use environment variables** - Keep all configuration in `.env.local`
4. **Verify recipients** - Ensure recipients have opted-in before transfers
5. **Check balances** - Validate sufficient funds before transactions
6. **Backup safely** - Store mnemonics securely offline, never in digital files

## Deployment Steps

### Testnet Deployment

1. Generate creator account
2. Fund with testnet ALGOs
3. Create ASA
4. Test transfers
5. Verify functionality

### Mainnet Deployment

1. Prepare funded mainnet account
2. Update network configuration
3. Create ASA on mainnet
4. Update website with Asset ID
5. Begin distribution
